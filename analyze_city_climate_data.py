    This function plots the average temperature for a particular city within CONUS over the course of a start year
    and an end year specified by the user. The average temperatures correspond either to the annual average (average across
    an entire year) or the average temperature for one month for that year which is also specified by the user. The
    time series plot generated is interactive for the user. This function MUST be ran by the user due to the nature of the
    plotting software used for the dropdown widgets.
    
    Inputs:
    location (string): structured "City, ST" in which the state is the two letter state abbreviation.
    
    timescale (string): Either "Annual" or one of the months of the year.
    
    start_year (integer): the year that will mark the start of the time series
    
    end_year (integer): the year that will mark the end of the time series
    
    Returns:
    Time series plotly plot of the average temperature across a certain timescale for a location.
