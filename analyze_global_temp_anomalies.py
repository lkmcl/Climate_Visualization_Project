    This function plots the average temperature anomalies (deg C) based upon observational averages versus the 1951-1980
    climateology. The function loads the monthly anomaly data (from the Global Historical Climate Network)
    for 2 by 2 degree latitude and longitude zones across the globe with a resolution of 1200km. This is loaded as is
    from a .nc file and then sliced based upon the year and the month provided by the user. This data is then plotted
    using basemap and pcolormesh to illustrate the anomalies across the globe.
    
    Inputs:
    year (integer): the year of the average temperature anomalies to be pulled
    
    month (string): the month pertaining to the average temperature anomalies desired for said month
    
    Returns:
    Global Temperature Anomalies Map illustrating the temperature difference from average for that month of the year.
