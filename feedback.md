#### Comments:
Everything was exceptional, the amount of work, the plots and the ease of use. Two minor comments:
-  for the future,  you may want to look into something like docker which creates a virtual environment so that the user doesn't have to load all these packages. 
- you can use .py files rather than .ipynb files for the modules that you want to export. This will create fewer dependencies (always a good thing).

I enjoyed your project and it exceeded my expectations. I am glad you got the chance to explore new packages and hope it is useful for you in the future.
